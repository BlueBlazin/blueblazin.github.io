As a part computer science, part other things blog, I thought it would be appropriate to title this first blog post as **Init 0**.
So here's Article #0: Initial Article


In this light blog post, I'd like to talk about the interesting technique of answering a question by asking it. More specifically, by writing it down. 

Many years ago, when I was a new physics undergraduate student, I did an online course on Electricity & Magnetism offered by Rice University, and taught by Jason Hafner. As our course progressed, the forums became rich with discussions. Professor Hafner was surprisingly very active on these forums himself, unlike many online courses you'll encounter where the instructors usually don't interact much. While interacting with the students, Jason realized something interesting. 

From feedback received from students, as well as his own observations, he realized that people were figuring out the answers to their own questions as they were trying to type them out. Intuitively, most of us who have written down questions for whatever reasons will agree with this. 

As you try to phrase a question in as precise and unambiguous a language as possible, there is an increased clarity about it. Sometimes, just as you are trying to formulate the question, you start to realize new things that you missed before. A fragmented mental picture starts to arrange itself, so to speak. 

I have experienced this myself, most often when asking questions on StackExchange. I've stopped midway into asking a question because I realized something that then helped me answer it myself. This is perhaps one of the reasons why discussion forums are of such importance in online courses. 

In the end, this is one of the reasons why I've started this blog. In expressing some of the topics I'll eventually write about in clear and unambiguous English, I hope to improve my own understanding of them. Maybe it will work, or maybe it won't, but either ways, thank you for reading.
